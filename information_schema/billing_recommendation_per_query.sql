-- This query will look at every query ran over the specified timeframe and determine if it is better to be run
-- under an on-demand or an Editions pricing billing model. In the final resultset, it will recommend on-demand 
-- or an Edition (or an Edition with a commit period) for each Edition type and commit period

/*
 *  This query does some real-world estimations of actual costs of Editions when using the autoscaler.
 *  It gets to this by utilizing a few nuances of the autoscaler and its behavior,
 *  namely that each query is billed for a minimum of 1 minute and
 *  slots are billed in increments of 100 (rounds up to nearest 100).
